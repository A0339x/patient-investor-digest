        "body": "Kelp DAO's rsETH -- a liquid restaking token (LRT), meaning a token representing ETH you have deposited into a third-party staking protocol to earn extra yield -- was drained of roughly $292 million through a LayerZero bridge attack. The protocol's emergency pause came 46 minutes after the drain. For any LP holding an ETH/rsETH range, that window would have been catastrophic: as rsETH lost its peg (meaning its market price fell sharply below its expected 1:1 ratio with ETH), arbitrage bots would have swept all the cheap rsETH out of the pool, leaving LPs holding only rsETH at a steep loss. This is an oracle depeg event -- when one asset in your pair breaks from its expected value, your entire range fills up with the now-damaged token before you can react.",

        "body": "After holding below resistance since last September, BTC pushed through this week, and prediction markets are pointing toward $84,000 next. For LPs in BTC-based pairs, this is the moment a skewed range earns its keep -- a range set above current price rather than centered on it stays active longer as price climbs, while a centered range like $74,000--$78,000 earns fees right now but gets left behind if BTC runs to $84K and exits the range entirely. The tradeoff is real: a skewed range like $76,000--$90,000 earns fewer fees while price is still at the bottom, but it captures the appreciation and keeps collecting fees all the way up. Neither choice is wrong; the right answer depends on how confident you are in the breakout holding.",

For any LP in a RAVE pair during the spike, here is exactly what happened: as RAVE's price shot up, arbitrageurs bought all the underpriced RAVE out of the liquidity pool, leaving LPs holding only the other asset (say, USDC). When RAVE then crashed, those LPs watched a token they no longer held fall -- this is impermanent loss (IL -- the opportunity cost of holding a position in a pool versus simply holding both tokens in your wallet) at its most extreme, where a violent move followed by a reversal leaves you worse off than doing nothing. Concentrated ranges in tight bands amplify this effect because there is no buffer outside the range to slow the drain.",

        "body": "This week BTC broke out while ETH barely moved, meaning the two assets are diverging. In any pool that pairs a BTC-correlated token with ETH, that spread directly increases impermanent loss, even if neither asset crashed. The logic is straightforward: IL grows whenever the price ratio between your two assets shifts from where it was when you opened the position, regardless of direction. If your range was sized around last week's BTC/ETH ratio and BTC has since outrun ETH by several percent, your position is already skewed -- you are holding more ETH and less BTC-exposure than you intended, and you may be earning fewer fees because the active price has drifted toward one edge of your range.",

For LPs, this matters in two indirect ways: large mining buildouts increase steady sell pressure on BTC, since miners sell a portion of rewards to cover operating costs, which can act as a ceiling on sharp price spikes. At the same time, committing significant capital to new mining operations signals that institutional players expect BTC prices to stay high enough to justify the investment -- a mild bullish signal for where long-term range targets might sit. It is a useful reminder that LP decisions do not happen in isolation; macro forces like mining economics shape the price ranges that actually matter for your positions.",

When an LRT depegs (meaning its price falls away from the ETH it is supposed to track at a near 1:1 ratio), any LP position holding that asset can suffer losses far beyond normal impermanent loss (IL). IL is the loss you experience when the price ratio of your two assets shifts away from where it was when you entered the pool -- and a sudden depeg can make that shift extreme and nearly instant. If your range was set assuming rsETH trades close to ETH and it suddenly trades at a steep discount, you could find your entire position converted into the depreciating asset with your range completely out of bounds.",

A trend break like this is exactly the scenario where a skewed range -- one shifted toward the upside rather than centered on the current price -- starts to earn more fees than a centered one. A centered range captures movement equally above and below the current price; a skewed range bets that price will travel more in one direction, concentrating your liquidity where you expect fees to be earned. The tradeoff is real: a skewed range goes out-of-range much faster if price moves the wrong way, so it rewards conviction but punishes passive neglect.",

For LPs, providing liquidity during a pump is particularly dangerous because of how IL works: as the token price spikes, the pool automatically sells the token and buys more of the other asset. When the price crashes back down, you are left holding mostly the less-valuable asset, and the IL can easily exceed any fees you collected during the chaos. Binance and Bitget have opened investigations, a signal that exchange scrutiny on manipulated tokens is intensifying -- but that scrutiny comes after the damage, not before.",

A wrapped asset is a token that represents another asset on a different blockchain -- wXRP is XRP locked somewhere, with an IOU token issued on Solana. New wrapped-asset pools often offer above-average fee rates early on because liquidity is thin and traders pay a wider spread to get in and out. The flip side is that thin liquidity also means wider price swings, a higher chance of your range going out-of-range quickly, and less certainty about how the price will behave once larger players enter the pool.",

For LPs, this matters because it confirms that memecoin pools operate with very limited legal recourse if things go wrong. If you provide liquidity on a memecoin and it collapses in a rug pull -- where developers drain the project and disappear -- you have almost no path to recovery through the courts. Your only real protection is due diligence before you enter: checking whether the pool's liquidity is locked, whether the token contract has admin keys that could be misused, and whether the project has any track record worth trusting.",
